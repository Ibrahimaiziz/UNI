  <p class="ex1">BS (CS) program aims at developing a sound foundation in the principles of computer science and mathematics enabling the students to apply these principles to problems requiring computer solutions. During this program, the students will learn a proficient use of modern theory, programming techniques, development processes, and tools used to develop computer applications in order to solve scientific and engineering problems. An updated knowledge on the current and modern trends in the field of computer science will continue to be an integral part of the program. The affable and jovial environment will help them enhance their technical skills through guidance and rigorous training. Further, a thorough learning system at NFC-IET encourages students to communicate effectively, either independently or in a team, and to solve problems using computing principles. Successful graduates then will be able to apply their computer science knowledge and skills for the overall benefit of society. In addition to that the program has been designed in view of the emerging needs of the software industry and it meets all the requirements laid down by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.</p>
